This library provides common cryptographic mechanisms based on different algorithms.

The Ballerina `crypto` library facilitates APIs to do operations like hashing, HMAC generation, checksum generation, encryption, decryption, signing data digitally, verifying digitally signed data, etc., with different cryptographic algorithms.

### Hashes

The `crypto` library supports generating hashes with 5 different hash algorithms MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512. Also, it supports generating the CRC32B checksum.

### HMAC

The `crypto` library supports generating HMAC with 5 different hash algorithms: MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512.

### Decode private/public key

The `crypto` library supports decoding the RSA private key from a `.p12` file and a key file in the `PEM` format. Also, it supports decoding a public key from a `.p12` file and a certificate file in the `X509` format. Additionally, this supports building an RSA public key with the modulus and exponent parameters.

### Encrypt and decrypt

The `crypto` library supports both symmetric key encryption/decryption and asymmetric key encryption/decryption. The RSA algorithm can be used for asymmetric-key encryption/decryption with the use of private and public keys. The AES algorithm can be used for symmetric-key encryption/decryption with the use of a shared key.

### Sign and verify

The `crypto` library supports signing data using the RSA private key and verification of the signature using the RSA public key. This supports MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 digesting algorithms, and ML-DSA-65 post-quantum signature algorithm as well.

### Key Derivation Function (KDF)

The `crypto` module supports HMAC-based Key Derivation Function (HKDF). HKDF is a key derivation function that uses a Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) to derive keys.

### Key Exchange Mechanism (KEM)

The `crypto` module supports Key Exchange Mechanisms (KEM). It includes RSA-KEM and post-quantum ML-KEM-768 for both encapsulation and decapsulation.

### Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE)

The `crypto` module supports Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE). It supports post-quantum ML-KEM-768-HPKE and RSA-KEM-ML-KEM-768-HPKE for encryption and decryption.

## Issues and projects

Issues and Projects tabs are disabled for this repository as this is part of the Ballerina Standard Library.

This repository only contains the source code for the module.

## Build from the source

### Set up the prerequisites

1. Download and install Java SE Development Kit (JDK) version 21 (from one of the following locations).

   * [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
   
   * [OpenJDK](https://adoptium.net)
   
        > **Note:** Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the path name of the directory into which you installed JDK.

2. Export your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with the `read package` permission as follows:

    ```
    export packageUser=<Username>
    export packagePAT=<Personal Access Token>
    ```

### Build the source

Execute the commands below to build from the source.

1. To build the package:
